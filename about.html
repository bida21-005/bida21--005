                <h5>ABOUT US</h5>
                <p> Partnering with some of world's top filmmakers is a major part of "PLAY-MOVIES THEATERS" mission. 
                    Our various technologies and services extend beyond our cameras and our proprietary DMR process and can be scaled to suit a variety of needs. 
                    Leading directors are increasingly asking PLAY-MOVIES THEATERS to join the moviemaking process from the very start. For a growing number of movies.<br> 
                    PLAY-MOVIES is part of the movie's DNA. That means, oftentimes, a PLAY-MOVIES' movie is conceived as a PLAY-MOVIES' movie, with the filmmaker working with PLAY-MOVIES to decide which parts should be shot with the PLAY-MOVIES camera and what kinds of techniques make the most of the PLAY-MOVIES screen, sound and theatre, and how the drama should unfold to take advantage of PLAY-MOVIES' larger format, richer color, sheer scale and impact.
                    <br>PLAY-MOVIES THEATERS also offers snacks and drinks for its well valued customers to extract the feeling of being at home. Comfortability is well taken of and considered.
